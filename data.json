They can either work in a research setting, focusing on populations as a whole, or as clinical epidemiologists, concentrating on patients. If you're working in research, you'll focus on the patterns and causes of diseases by using statistics and model building to find out whether something occurs and also how it occurs. You'll study samples of the population that include healthy and unhealthy individuals. You won't normally collect the data directly from affected groups, but will analyse data given to you. Your work will inform public health policies and global strategies in order to prevent future outbreaks and epidemics of a disease. By contrast, if you're working in a clinical setting, you'll study the disease in individual patients and focus on how the disease has developed. This area of work is best suited to medically-qualified epidemiologists."
